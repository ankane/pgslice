# pgslice

Postgres partitioning as easy as pie. Works great for both new and existing tables, with zero downtime and minimal app changes. No need to install anything on your database server. Archive older data on a rolling basis to keep your database size under control.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/pgslice/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ankane/pgslice/actions)

## Install

pgslice is a command line tool. To install, run:

```sh
gem install pgslice
```

This will give you the `pgslice` command. You can also install it with [Homebrew](#homebrew) or [Docker](#docker). If installation fails, you may need to install [dependencies](#dependencies).

## Steps

1. Ensure the table you want to partition has been created. We’ll refer to this as `<table>`.

2. Specify your database credentials

  ```sh
  export PGSLICE_URL=postgres://localhost/myapp_development
  ```

3. Create an intermediate table

  ```sh
  pgslice prep <table> <column> <period>
  ```

  The column should be a `timestamp`, `timestamptz`, or `date` column and period can be `day`, `month`, or `year`.

  This creates a partitioned table named `<table>_intermediate` using range partitioning.

4. Add partitions to the intermediate table

  ```sh
  pgslice add_partitions <table> --intermediate --past 3 --future 3
  ```

  Use the `--past` and `--future` options to control the number of partitions.

5. *Optional, for tables with data* - Fill the partitions in batches with data from the original table

  ```sh
  pgslice fill <table>
  ```

  Use the `--batch-size` and `--sleep` options to control the speed (defaults to `10000` and `0` respectively)

  To sync data across different databases, check out [pgsync](https://github.com/ankane/pgsync).

6. Analyze tables

  ```sh
  pgslice analyze <table>
  ```

7. Swap the intermediate table with the original table

  ```sh
  pgslice swap <table>
  ```

  The original table is renamed `<table>_retired` and the intermediate table is renamed `<table>`.

8. Fill the rest (rows inserted between the first fill and the swap)

  ```sh
  pgslice fill <table> --swapped
  ```

9. Back up the retired table with a tool like [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgdump.html) and drop it

  ```sql
  pg_dump -c -Fc -t <table>_retired $PGSLICE_URL > <table>_retired.dump
  psql -c "DROP TABLE <table>_retired" $PGSLICE_URL
  ```

## Sample Output

pgslice prints the SQL commands that were executed on the server. To print without executing, use the `--dry-run` option.

```sh
pgslice prep visits created_at month
```

```sql
BEGIN;

CREATE TABLE "public"."visits_intermediate" (LIKE "public"."visits" INCLUDING DEFAULTS INCLUDING CONSTRAINTS INCLUDING STORAGE INCLUDING COMMENTS INCLUDING STATISTICS INCLUDING GENERATED INCLUDING COMPRESSION) PARTITION BY RANGE ("created_at");

CREATE INDEX ON "public"."visits_intermediate" USING btree ("created_at");

COMMENT ON TABLE "public"."visits_intermediate" is 'column:created_at,period:month,cast:date,version:3';

COMMIT;
```

```sh
pgslice add_partitions visits --intermediate --past 1 --future 1
```

```sql
BEGIN;

CREATE TABLE "public"."visits_202208" PARTITION OF "public"."visits_intermediate" FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-08-01') TO ('2022-09-01');

ALTER TABLE "public"."visits_202208" ADD PRIMARY KEY ("id");

CREATE TABLE "public"."visits_202209" PARTITION OF "public"."visits_intermediate" FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-09-01') TO ('2022-10-01');

ALTER TABLE "public"."visits_202209" ADD PRIMARY KEY ("id");

CREATE TABLE "public"."visits_202210" PARTITION OF "public"."visits_intermediate" FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-10-01') TO ('2022-11-01');

ALTER TABLE "public"."visits_202210" ADD PRIMARY KEY ("id");

COMMIT;
```

```sh
pgslice fill visits
```

```sql
/* 1 of 3 */
INSERT INTO "public"."visits_intermediate" ("id", "user_id", "ip", "created_at")
    SELECT "id", "user_id", "ip", "created_at" FROM "public"."visits"
    WHERE "id" > 0 AND "id" <= 10000 AND "created_at" >= '2022-08-01'::date AND "created_at" < '2022-11-01'::date

/* 2 of 3 */
INSERT INTO "public"."visits_intermediate" ("id", "user_id", "ip", "created_at")
    SELECT "id", "user_id", "ip", "created_at" FROM "public"."visits"
    WHERE "id" > 10000 AND "id" <= 20000 AND "created_at" >= '2022-08-01'::date AND "created_at" < '2022-11-01'::date

/* 3 of 3 */
INSERT INTO "public"."visits_intermediate" ("id", "user_id", "ip", "created_at")
    SELECT "id", "user_id", "ip", "created_at" FROM "public"."visits"
    WHERE "id" > 20000 AND "id" <= 30000 AND "created_at" >= '2022-08-01'::date AND "created_at" < '2022-11-01'::date
```

```sh
pgslice analyze visits
```

```sql
ANALYZE VERBOSE "public"."visits_202208";

ANALYZE VERBOSE "public"."visits_202209";

ANALYZE VERBOSE "public"."visits_202210";

ANALYZE VERBOSE "public"."visits_intermediate";
```

```sh
pgslice swap visits
```

```sql
BEGIN;

SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '5s';

ALTER TABLE "public"."visits" RENAME TO "visits_retired";

ALTER TABLE "public"."visits_intermediate" RENAME TO "visits";

ALTER SEQUENCE "public"."visits_id_seq" OWNED BY "public"."visits"."id";

COMMIT;
```

## Adding Partitions

To add partitions, use:

```sh
pgslice add_partitions <table> --future 3
```

Add this as a cron job to create a new partition each day, month, or year.

```sh
# day
0 0 * * * pgslice add_partitions <table> --future 3 --url ...

# month
0 0 1 * * pgslice add_partitions <table> --future 3 --url ...

# year
0 0 1 1 * pgslice add_partitions <table> --future 3 --url ...
```

Add a monitor to ensure partitions are being created.

```sql
SELECT 1 FROM
    pg_catalog.pg_class c
INNER JOIN
    pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
WHERE
    c.relkind = 'r' AND
    n.nspname = 'public' AND
    c.relname = '<table>_' || to_char(NOW() + INTERVAL '3 days', 'YYYYMMDD')
    -- for months, use to_char(NOW() + INTERVAL '3 months', 'YYYYMM')
    -- for years, use to_char(NOW() + INTERVAL '3 years', 'YYYY')
```

## Archiving Partitions

Back up and drop older partitions each day, month, or year.

```sh
pg_dump -c -Fc -t <table>_202209 $PGSLICE_URL > <table>_202209.dump
psql -c "DROP TABLE <table>_202209" $PGSLICE_URL
```

If you use [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for backups, [s3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd) is a nice tool.

```sh
s3cmd put <table>_202209.dump s3://<s3-bucket>/<table>_202209.dump
```

## Schema Updates

Once a table is partitioned, make schema updates on the master table only (not partitions). This includes adding, removing, and modifying columns, as well as adding and removing indexes and foreign keys.

## Additional Commands

To undo prep (which will delete partitions), use:

```sh
pgslice unprep <table>
```

To undo swap, use:

```sh
pgslice unswap <table>
```

## Additional Options

Set the tablespace when adding partitions

```sh
pgslice add_partitions <table> --tablespace fastspace
```

## App Considerations

This set up allows you to read and write with the original table name with no knowledge it’s partitioned. However, there are a few things to be aware of.

### Reads

When possible, queries should include the column you partition on to limit the number of partitions the database needs to check. For instance, if you partition on `created_at`, try to include it in queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM
    visits
WHERE
    user_id = 123 AND
    -- for performance
    created_at >= '2022-09-01' AND created_at < '2022-09-02'
```

For this to be effective, ensure `constraint_exclusion` is set to `partition` (the default value) or `on`.

```sql
SHOW constraint_exclusion;
```

## Frameworks

### Rails

Specify the primary key for partitioned models to ensure it’s returned.

```ruby
class Visit < ApplicationRecord
  self.primary_key = "id"
end
```

### Other Frameworks

Please submit a PR if additional configuration is needed.

## One Off Tasks

You can also use pgslice to reduce the size of a table without partitioning by creating a new table, filling it with a subset of records, and swapping it in.

```sh
pgslice prep <table> --no-partition
pgslice fill <table> --where "id > 1000" # use any conditions
pgslice swap <table>
```

## Triggers

Triggers aren’t copied from the original table. You can set up triggers on the intermediate table if needed. Note that Postgres doesn’t support `BEFORE / FOR EACH ROW` triggers on partitioned tables.

## Data Protection

Always make sure your [connection is secure](https://ankane.org/postgres-sslmode-explained) when connecting to a database over a network you don’t fully trust. Your best option is to connect over SSH or a VPN. Another option is to use `sslmode=verify-full`. If you don’t do this, your database credentials can be compromised.

## Additional Installation Methods

### Homebrew
